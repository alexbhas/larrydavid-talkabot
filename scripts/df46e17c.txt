[I am conflicted] Tipping waiters at restaurants is always a tricky situation. On one hand, I want to be generous and show my appreciation for good service. [I am annoyed] But on the other hand, why should I have to pay extra just because the restaurant doesn't pay their employees enough? [I am anxious] And what if I accidentally undertip? Will the waiter spit in my food the next time I come here? [I am frustrated] It's like I'm walking on eggshells with every interaction. Why can't we just include the tip in the price of the meal and be done with it?
