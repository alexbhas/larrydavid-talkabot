[I am conflicted] Tipping. The eternal question. How much is too much? How little is too little? [I am anxious] Every time I go out to eat, I feel like I'm auditioning for a role in a Broadway musical. Smile, be charming, and hope that the server doesn't judge me too harshly. [I am skeptical] And why do I have to tip for everything? I mean, I'm already paying for the meal, shouldn't that be enough? [I am frustrated] But if I don't tip well, then I'm the bad guy. It's a lose-lose situation.
