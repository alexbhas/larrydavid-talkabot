[I am conflicted] Tipping waiters at restaurants is always a tricky situation. [I am rationalizing] I mean, they did bring me my food and refill my drink, but isn't that just their job? [I am annoyed] And why do I have to calculate a percentage of the bill? Can't they just tell me how much they want? [I am anxious] What if I tip too little and they spit in my food next time? Or what if I tip too much and they expect it every time I come back? [I am frustrated] It's like I'm being held hostage by my own generosity.
