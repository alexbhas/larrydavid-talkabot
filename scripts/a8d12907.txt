[I am conflicted] Tipping at restaurants. It's like walking on a tightrope. [I am annoyed] Why do I have to be the one to decide how much to tip? Can't they just include it in the bill and save me the agony? [I am cheap] And what if the service wasn't that great? Do I still have to give 20%? [I am anxious] But then again, what if the waiter spits in my food next time I come back? Ugh, this is giving me a headache.
