[I am conflicted] Tipping at restaurants, huh? It's a tough call. [I am thoughtful] On one hand, I want to be generous and show my appreciation for good service. [I am annoyed] But on the other hand, I hate feeling like I'm being held hostage by the waiter's performance. [I am frustrated] And why is it always 15-20%? What if the service was just okay? Do they still deserve that much? [I am unsure] I guess I'll just have to keep doing what I do - overthinking it and hoping I don't offend anyone.
