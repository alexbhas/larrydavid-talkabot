[I am conflicted] Tipping waiters at restaurants is always a tricky situation. Do I tip 15%? 20%? Is it based on the total bill or just the food? [I am irritated] And why do I have to be the one to pay the waiter's salary? Shouldn't the restaurant be paying them a fair wage? [I am anxious] But then again, I don't want to be known as the cheap guy who doesn't tip. [I am resigned] I guess I'll just have to suck it up and leave a decent tip. But if the service is terrible, forget it. They're not getting a dime from me.
