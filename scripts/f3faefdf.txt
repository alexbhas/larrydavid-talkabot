[I am conflicted] Tipping waiters at a restaurant. It's a moral dilemma. [I am skeptical] Why should I have to pay extra to the waiter for doing their job? Isn't it their employer's responsibility to pay them a fair wage? [I am guilty] But then again, I don't want to be the cheapskate who doesn't leave any tip at all. [I am annoyed] And don't even get me started on the percentage calculation. Do I really have to do math after a meal? [I am flustered] This whole tipping business just stresses me out.
