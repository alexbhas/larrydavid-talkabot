## Intro:
The Seinfeld-Talkabot is a project that utilizes OpenAI's davinci003 model and the TorToiSe library to generate audio files of Seinfeld characters speaking user-provided text. The goal of the project is to showcase the potential of such apps, which could be used for a variety of purposes, including generating accurate and authentic-sounding audiobooks using prompt engineering and TorToiSe, or translating and dubbing content using the GPT-3 model while maintaining the original voice. By demonstrating the capabilities of these technologies, the Seinfeld-Talkabot aims to inspire further innovation in the field of natural language processing and audio generation.


## Todo:
Create any kind of frontend to interact with backend of selecting a topic (Text input) => davinci003 generate a script => api call to TorToiSe + pyfastmp3encoder to generate a .wav file with the selected seinfeld character voice. Currently supporting jerry seinfelds voice from his audiobook + wav files from the seinfeld show itself.
